# Project Files Access 📂🗄️🗃️

Due to the large sizes of the project's files and limited bandwidth and Storage usage, the project had to be uploaded using Google Drive and providing the link to access it.

The provided link below includes the **README.md** file, the **'Notebooks and Data'** folder and the **'Images - Videos'** folder. 

#### **The data needed to run the notebooks is inside the *'Notebook and Data'* folder. They are in their respective directories relative to the notebooks' directory, which need to be saved inside the *'Notebooks and Data'* folder to run smoothly.** 

The 'Notebooks and Data' folder includes:

* 5 separate notebooks 📓📓📓 

* 1 'Models' folder 📂

* 1 'Logs_Full_Set' folder 📂
